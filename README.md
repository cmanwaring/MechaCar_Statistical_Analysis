## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression to Predict MPG Summary Output](images/mpg_summary_output.png)  
### Summary
The variables/coefficients that seem to contribute the most non-random variance are, in order from most non-random variance to least non-random variance are: vehicle_length, ground_clearance, and vehicle_weight; although the vehicle_weight it just outside of normal significance with a p-value of 0.0776.  
The slope of the linear model is not zero. The 'Multiple R-squared" is 0.7149, meaning that there are some variables that contribute slope to our linear regression.
The linear model does not alone predict the mpw of MechaCar. It does show a corelation between the vehicle_length and ground_clearance and the mpg of a vehicle. These findings could be used when designing the MechaCar, or be measured to try and anticipate a projected mpg.
